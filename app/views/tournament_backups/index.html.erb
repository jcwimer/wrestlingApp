<h3>Tournament Backups</h3>
<p>You can click on the timestamp to view the backup text. You can manually store this anywhere you'd like and then paste it into the manual import field below.
Doing this is risky, if the text is formatted incorrectly (like Microsoft Word changing the quotation marks), it will not import properly
and will also delete all of your current data. It's best to use the create backup function.</p>

It will delete all current data from the tournament in order to restore the backup." }, class: 'fas fa-undo-alt text-warning', title: 'Restore Backup' %>

<h3>Import Manual Backup</h3>
<p>Paste the backup text here. Note, if this is formatted wrong, you'll need to restore a backup from above to fix it and you'll see an error in your background jobs.</p>
