- If rails isn't installed use docker: docker run -it -v $(pwd):/rails wrestlingdev-dev <rails command>
- If the docker image doesn't exist, use the build command: docker build -t wrestlingdev-dev -f deploy/rails-dev-Dockerfile .
- If the Gemfile changes, you need to rebuild the docker image: docker build -t wrestlingdev-dev -f deploy/rails-dev-Dockerfile.
- Do not add unnecessary comments to the code where you remove things.
